## Features and Benefits

### Data binding
The Accordion control allows the use of .NET MAUI [BindableLayout](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/accordion/bindablelayout?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-accordion-github-samples) to bind a data collection and populate the control.

### Expand and collapse
The Accordion control allows users to interactively and programmatically customize the expand and collapse actions.

### Animation
Enhances the user experience with animated transitions for item expansion and collapse. The animations can be customized by turning them on or off, adjusting the duration of the expanding and collapsing animations, and modifying the easing style.

### Visual state manager
Modify the appearance of Accordion items according to their expanded and collapsed states by utilizing the [visual state manager](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/accordion/appearance#visual-state-manager?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-accordion-github-samples).

### Expander icon position
